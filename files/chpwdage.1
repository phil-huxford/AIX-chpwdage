.SH INTRODUCTION

is be used to add a 
.B ADMCHG
flag to users in the /etc/security/passwd file.
This flag does not change a users password, but the user
will be prompt to change their password next time they log in.
This can apply to all users immediately, if 
there is a cybersecurity event for example, or you
can specify a UNIX timestamp and any password that
was changed before that timestamp will be flagged to be reset.

You can choose to exclude system users (if you maintain a list of them).

.SH FLAGS

of system users and do not specify a flag, you will be asked 
if you want to include them.

.B \-h
flag will display the help file (this man page).

you will get the following error:

"No system user list found, please see the man page."

The
.B \-e
flag is used to 
.B exclude 
system users from the list of users to be flagged.
If you use this flag and do not have a list of system users,
